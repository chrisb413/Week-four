-I chose to learn about Excel because i havent used this program in 6 or so years.  This assignment is to rejog my memory and hopefully learn a number of things on the way.

- When launching Excel and trying to open the csv file I got prompted with the Text Import Wizard.  After a few minutes of fiddling around with that i got the table to display properly.
-Okay, nevermind.  That was a very quick refresher.  Already knew about graphing and =sum() from highschool.
-Guess ill finish looking at the R section.
	- This exercise went fairly well.  No real hicupps or troublesome areas.
	- Installed RCurl, got the data with getURL command and saved it to a variable called documents.  
	- After that i continued to follow the instructions and produced a histogram.

-Overall, it was nice to be able to learn how to insert large amounts of data into Excel, organize them, and then plot more complex graphs (with the ability to customize the table too)


# Reflection Questions: #
In your journal.md for this week, think about how the various authors in the readings make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced. 
Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not. 
What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 
What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? 
How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it?
How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

- *Not sure what makes their arguments advanced. Personally i believe the digital historian has a more difficult (and in that way, advanced) job.  They have to look at non-digitized sources like every other historian, however, they record it in a completely different platform.
	- This requires knowledge in both physical and digital areas unlike traditional historians.
- 
- 
- In this class we use the data we were given in very different ways.  Here we produce graphs, tables, organize it, create visual maps, etc.  Traditional history classes have you write essays on everything you read to prove you read it.
-
- This question is confusing to me.  Priori, according to google this word means knowledge is obtained by analyzing a concept independent of experience.  This sounds like the term conceptual knowledge.  The better you are able to understand ideas free from actual experience i guess the less priori you need prior to reading??
